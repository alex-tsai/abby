#A/BBY
A [Framer](http://framerjs.com) module for quantitative usability testing using [Parse](http://parse.com). This module is currently is still very much so in the MVP stages.

Check out the tutorials ([1](https://medium.com/@gk3/using-parse-to-power-up-your-framer-prototypes-88cb87009d00)|[2] (https://medium.com/@gk3/give-your-framer-prototypes-a-better-memory-212b26e0f934)) by [@gk3](https://twitter.com/gk3) to learn about using Parse and Framer together. In my opinion, they're some of the easier to follow tutorials I've seen for Framer.
